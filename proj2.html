          <p> At YouTuneIn I worked in a team of three people to recreate Youtube, with a focus on front end and design. Our tech stack for this project was JavaScript, React, Node express, and MongoDB. Each member of the team created their own component of the application, which was ultimately rendered with a proxy server I developed. In addition to the proxy server, the component which I was primarily responsible for is the list of related videos. 

          </br></br> Working as a remote team, it was crucial that our communication be both consistent and efficient. I led daily standups to keep us on track, as well as organizing multi-day sprints to keep the team moving forward at a steady and unified pace. 
      
        </br></br> YouTuneIn was deplopyed using AWS elastic beanstalk.   </p>
